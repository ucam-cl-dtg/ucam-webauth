The University of Cambridge Web Authentication System Java Toolkit 
==================================================================

This toolkit provides assorted classes implementing functionality
associated with the University of Cambridge's Web Authentication
System (UcamWebAuth). UcamWebAuth is the software that implements the
University of Cambridge's 'Raven' system.

Current content of the package includes classes representing
authentication requests and responses (WebauthRequest and
WebauthResponse respectively), and a class for validating response
messages (WebauthValidator).


The Latest Version
------------------

See <http://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/java-toolkit/>


Installation
------------

A JAR file is provided containing the classes from this toolkit
ready-compiled. These can be made available to any Java program by
including the JAR file in the CLASSPATH. 

WebauthValidator needs access to a Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
security provider that implements the "SHA1withRSA" signature
scheme. This appears to be the case by default from at least Sun's
J2SE 1.3.  Failing that, Sun's JCE reference implementation from
http://java.sun.com/products/jce/ or Bouncycastle's JCE implementation
from http://www.bouncycastle.org/ may be of use.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is provided in the form of 'javadoc' files. Point a web
browser at javadoc/index.html.


Building
--------

The Maven tool <http://maven.apache.org/> is needed to rebuild the
toolkit. Assuming Maven is installed somewhere on PATH, the toolkit can
be rebuilt by executing the command

  maven compile 

from the root of the unpacked distribution. This will place the
freshly-compiled class files beneath the directory 'target/classes'. Other Maven
goals will run the provided JUnit tests, rebuild the JAR file and
rebuild the distribution jar files.


Questions
---------

Questions about the use of this toolkit should be addressed to
