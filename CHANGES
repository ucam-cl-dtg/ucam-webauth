0.6-20051129 JW

* Made WebauthRequest Serializable since there is a good chance many
  applications will want to keep the object around to use to validate
  a coresponding WebauthResponse

0.5-20050728 JW

* Corrected a bug (similar to that in 0.4) that caused request
  timestamps to be interpreted as if in localtime not UT. Extended
  test suite to catch this

0.4-20050331 JW

* Corrected a bug that caused response timestamps to be interpreted as
  if in localtime not UT. Extended test suite to catch this

* Modified date format in error messages to be more readable and
  include time zone. 

0.3-20050330 JW

* Significant re-working, including numerous incompatible changes to
  the API (sorry). Generally:

  + The dedicated get...()/set...() methods from WebauthRequest and
    WebauthResponse have been replaced by generic methods that take
    the name of a field to act on as their first argument.

  + get() always returns a String, but there are convenience methods
    (getInt(), getDate() and getColl() ) that return fields as an int,
    a date, or as a Collection. These throw exceptions if the required
    convertion isn't possible.

  + set() is overloaded to accept a String, an int, a date, or a
    Collection as the value to set.

  + getColl() and set() with a Collection argument can be used to
    handle list-based fields (such as 'aauth' in requests and 'sso' in
    responses) as a Collection of Strings.

  + WebauthRequest and WebauthResponse now have methods that return the
    number of fields that they contain, and a iterator to access them
    all.

  + WebauthResponse no-longer implements java.lang.Principal. As a
    result toString() now returns a human-readable summary of the
    entire object. toFullString() is gone.

  + WebauthRequest and WebauthResponse now generally DON'T throw
    exceptions (except as mentioned above under convenience
    methods. As a result they both now do less validity checking then
    they did.

  + Dates are now uniformly represented as a long containing the
    number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 GMT throughout.

* WebauthResponse.statusString() now accepts an int or a String
  argument.
 
* WebauthValidator checks that a status 200 response includes one of
  the 'auth' or 'sso' fields.

0.2-20050321 JW

* Added this file and TODO

* Added notes to README about the need for a security provider that
  implements the "SHA1withRSA" signature scheme, and the current use
  of sun.misc.BASE64Decoder

* Reworked (and commented!) timeout checking and get/set methods for
  Timeout and MaxSkew to cope with millisecond time resolution in Java
  but only second time resolution in response messages.

* Dropped use of URLEncoder.encode(String,String) in favour of
  'URLEncoder.encode(String)' since the former isn't present in
  1.3. Code now compiles and passes its tests in Java 1.3 (1.3.1_15),
  1.4 (1.4.2_07) and 5 (1.5.0_12)

* Added text from causal exception to "Failed to parse Webauth
  response issue date" and "Failed to parse Webauth response URL"
  messages. Can't use exception chaining becasue it's >=1.4 only.

* WebauthRequestTest and WebauthResponseTest reworked to use http:
  (rather than https:) URLs becasue 1.3 doesn't support https: out of
  the box.

* Moved the constants (STATUS_SUCCESS, etc) and the one remaining
  static method (statusString) from the Webauth class into
  WebauthResponse where they belong. Removed the Webauth class.

0.1-20050316 JW

* Initial release
